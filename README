some dotfiles
-------------

How I use it:

1. setup a new system

2. install git

3. change to home dir: `cd $HOME`

3. `git co git://github.com/cactus/dotconfigs.git .myconfigs`
# or `git co https://cactus@github.com/cactus/dotconfigs.git .myconfigs`
# depending on firewall rules

4. Run the 'move in' script: `.myconfigs/scripts/create_links.bash`
# Some action may be required. The script will report if any files already
# exist, and would cause a collision. Remove those files and run the script
# again. Rinse and repeat until no output is produced.

5. Source the new .bashrc: `. $HOME/.bashrc`

After I push a new change to the repo, and want to update the dotfiles on a
particular system. Note that dotfiles_update is a shell function now (exported
so I don't have to call the file directly anymore):

6. dotfiles_update
# this will also create symlinks for any new files

directories
-----------
scripts/        - contains the helper scripts to create symlinks and update
                  the dotfiles local repo
examples/       - some reference configs
dotfiles/       - the dot files for various things. these are symlinked to the
                  $HOME directory.
